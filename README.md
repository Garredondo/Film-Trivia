# TriviaGame

Film Trivia gives the user one minutes to answer five questions about various films. The user can select from five answers. A countdown clock is used to inform the user of the time remaining to answer the questions.

If the user finishes the quiz before the one minute, they can submit the game and check their score. A timeout is built in so if the user has not completed the game before the one minute mark, the game automatically submits and the results are displayed. 

Jquery was used to program the game. The program relies on timeout and intervals.
